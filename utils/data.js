Divide each batch of batter in half and separate into bowls. Add your choice of food coloring to each batter. When you are done, you should have six different color batters from 3 cake mixes.Using an 8 by 8 inch inch pan for each layer, bake according to package instructions.Remove from pans and cool on wire racks.When the cakes are cool, you may have to shave the risen part of each layer so that it will sit level in the stack.Fondant:In a large, nonmetal bowl, sift 2 pounds confectioner's sugar and make a well in the center. Set aside.In a small saucepan, add water and sprinkle gelatin on top to soften for about 5 minutes.Begin to heat the gelatin and stir until the gelatin is dissolved and clear. Do not boil.Remove from heat and add glucose and glycerine, stirring until well blended. Add flavoring.Pour into the well of sugar, and mix until all of the sugar is blended. Use hands to knead icing until it becomes stiff. Add small amounts of confectioner's sugar if the mixture is sticky.Divide into 6 equal portions and knead in food coloring to match the cake layers.Form into balls and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Place in an airtight container. This icing works best if allowed to rest at room temperature for about eight hours before using, particularly if the weather is humid. Do not refrigerate. Andy üç∞",
